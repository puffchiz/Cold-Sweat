# Cold-Sweat
Cold Sweat is a mod for Minecraft 1.19.2, 1.18.2, and 1.16.5 that adds a comprehensive temperature system to the game. This is the public repository for our project on CurseForge:

## Documentation
Documentation for 3rd-party integration with Cold Sweat can be found here (WIP, out-of-date for 2.2+):  
https://mikul.gitbook.io/cold-sweat/  
The current documentation is only designed for 1.18.2, but it should be useable for 1.16.5 as this mod aims for as much backend parity as possible.
